# Image Classification

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project is part of the *INF5082 – Gestion et analyse de données* course. The goal is to design, implement, and compare two complete image classification pipelines:  

1. **Traditional Machine Learning Pipeline**  
   - Feature extraction using pre-trained models (VGG16, AlexNet, InceptionV3).  
   - Training classifiers such as SVM, k-NN, Decision Tree, and Naïve Bayes.  

2. **Deep Learning Pipeline**  
   - Training a custom Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) directly on raw images.  
   - Evaluating and comparing performance against the traditional pipeline.  

The project highlights strengths, weaknesses, and trade-offs between classical approaches and modern deep learning techniques.
